# Leafer's Smart Lease

The apartment leasing procedure is riddled with overhead. This contract is in development to deploy a Dapp to handle all of the document creation, sign off, and rent payments. Eventually, this could be attached to a network of smart devices in the home to ensure maintenance outlined in the leasing agreement is fulfilled. Inspired by my recent apartment lease signing/notarizing headache.
